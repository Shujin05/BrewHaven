Welcome to Brew Haven, your neighborhood coffee shop located in the heart of the Central Business District of Singapore.

At Brew Haven, we believe that coffee is more than just a drink—it’s an experience, a moment of joy, and a way to connect with others. We strive to be the sanctuary where you can enjoy precious moments with your loved ones. 

Our Story
Founded in 2014, Brew Haven started as a small family-owned café with one mission: to share the love of quality, ethically-sourced coffee with our community. We ensure that every cup we brew tells a story of dedication and care, from farm to table. Our beans are roasted in-house to bring out unique flavors that reflect the regions where they were grown.

Just a click away, our delivery service ensures that you never miss your daily cup, no matter where you are.

Our Menu
Our menu offers something for everyone, from our signature espresso blends to refreshing cold brews, artisanal teas, and fresh-baked goods sourced from local bakeries. We also cater to a variety of dietary needs with a range of plant-based milk options and gluten-free snacks.

Community & Sustainability
At Brew Haven, we are more than just coffee. We are part of the community, and we care deeply about sustainability. We use eco-friendly packaging, and strive to minimize our carbon footprint. Our café regularly hosts events, such as live music nights, art showcases, and community fundraisers, making it a hub for creativity and connection.
